# NBAListViewApp-IOS-
 The app starts with a master list, which is a Table view. When an item in the master list
is touched, a detail view of the selected item will be presented. One level of details is
required, but you may have more.
My design presents the information in a clear and effective manner.
a. Use of a dynamic Table view for the master list.
b. Presents a well-designed detail view.
c. Uses images in the master list view.
