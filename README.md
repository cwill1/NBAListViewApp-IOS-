# NBAListViewApp-IOS-
 The app starts with a master list, which is a Table view. When an item in the master list
is touched, a detail view of the selected item will be presented. There is two levels of details contained within this app.
My design presents the information in a clear and effective manner.
This app makes use of a dynamic Table view for the master list, presents a well-designed detail view, and uses images in the master list view.
